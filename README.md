# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing


This project requires you to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites.

4th project at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

##Project Motivation
The motive of this project is to have you a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall architecture. You shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands, config setups, or structure that we create here. Every project in the industry will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces, you will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this one.
